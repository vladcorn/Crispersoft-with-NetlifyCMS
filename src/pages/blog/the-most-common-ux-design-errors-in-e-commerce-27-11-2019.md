## E-commerce design. Errors in UX.

UI / UX web design is a combination of solutions that are based on the behavioral factors of users and are designed to adapt an interaction with the site. Creating a convenient and harmonious interface involves the development of every detail, so novice designers often make mistakes in their work. Consider the most common examples of failed UX.

## Website design repels

The first impression of a blog or online store is formed in the first few seconds after it is downloaded in a browser. Professional UX website design is a successful combination of the color scheme of the design, the location of navigation elements and information sections. When all the content on the site looks nice, then luring the user is much easier. The most serious design mistakes:

* chaotic arrangement of elements;
* a large number of animations;
* pictures in low resolution;
* sloppy bright fonts;
* lack of navigation.

## The lack of a mobile version of the site

In 2019, sites without an adaptive layout or mobile version still exist. In this case, even with a version for smartphones, many developers do not take into account the UX-component. The behavior and purpose of the visit of a visitor using a smartphone may differ, therefore, it is necessary to take into account behavioral factors not only when creating a desktop version of a page. The owner of a mobile gadget also wants to get the information he is interested in as quickly as possible. The developerâ€™s task is to make as much information as possible available in the mobile version and explain why some features are only possible on a PC.

## Bad, confusing navigation

Inconvenient navigation is a good reason to close the site and never return to it again. There is no need for endless page scrolling and a dozen clicks on obscure links if competitors have all the information available in 3 clicks through the navigation panel. The user must immediately understand where he will go when he clicks on a specific menu item. You should not increase traffic to unpopular pages and build inadequate linking.

## Lack of basic information (payment, delivery, the return of goods)

You will have to wait a long time to increase the conversion if the user cannot immediately order the product. Possible payment options, delivery periods and return procedures are what everyone who visits the site wants to know to make a purchase. If this information cannot be found, then the credibility of the seller drops sharply.

## The shopping process is complicated

If the user has to spend too much time to complete the target action, then the likelihood that he will finish what he started is not high. Mandatory registration scares off as well as secret prices, which can be found out only after filling out the feedback form. Not everyone is ready for unnecessary communications, so the process of purchasing goods needs to be simplified as much as possible.

## The shopping process is boring

Not always a conceptual model is ideal for the user. In some cases, market and target data lead to a too simple interface that competitors use. Do not be afraid to stand out, but the main thing is the care of the user.

## Unreadable description of the product or placed in an uncomfortable place

Web solutions for e-commerce that do not give users the information they need to look strange. The description should not be placed at the very bottom of the page under the end-to-end blocks - most likely, no one will ever know the necessary information but simply refuse the purchase. Basics of text design: the use of headers, graphic elements, and lists. All this allows you to quickly find the information you need and not read the text completely. It is necessary to give the user a choice.

## Obsessive involvement and unreasonable use of pop-ups

The times when pop-ups led to a rapid increase in sales are long gone. Now they are convenient for use as additional tools for collecting data or conducting surveys. Promptly advertise products using a pop-up window is the best strategy in order to cause the user to be rejected. At the same time, Google lowers the rating of sites that have banners covering the main content. Also, do not forget that from a smartphone such windows can be difficult or impossible to close - the percentage of failures from mobile devices will increase immediately after the introduction of pop-up banners.

## How to fix or prevent mistakes in e-commerce

Website development and creation are, first of all, user care. It is required to take into account the needs and specifics of the target audience when working on the design, so as not to lose customers in vain and constantly attract targeted traffic. The best is the enemy of the good, and every designer can make a mistake. We must not forget that user experience is more important than beautiful design. To fix the flaws, you need to understand exactly how the potential client interacts with the site, what he wants to find there and give him that.
