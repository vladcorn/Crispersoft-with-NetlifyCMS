## How the website design affects sales and why the redesign is necessary

Most owners of commercial websites (portals, online stores, catalogs) often underestimate design as a significant part of the success of building a business.

Large commercial sites located on the top lines of search engines, as well as eminent market leaders, carry out a complete redesign of their resources at least 1 time in 3 years! This approach allows them not only to hold positions but also to increase the volume and loyalty of the user audience every month.

## How the website redesign can boost sales

A site is one of the links that form the complete business model of a company.

A beautiful, convenient and intuitive website design helps not only increase conversion, but also form a whole group of users who will admire the new way, share their impressions with colleagues and friends.

Professional redesign of the site, taking into account the characteristics of the business, allows you to get the following advantages:

* increase in the number of new users;
* growth of user loyalty;
* increase in sales and leads;
* buildup of behavioral factors (viewing depth and time on the site);
* audience involvement in the use of functional elements;
* tidying up the site in terms of UX / UI;
* layout improvement.

## Adaptive markup - another argument in favor of updating

A huge number of websites created 7-10 years ago don’t have an adaptive layout. Time has changed and today the presence of adaptive layout is not just a bonus or a useful user thing, but a necessity.

With the growing share of mobile traffic, a trend has ripened: all sites should have an adaptive layout, which allows them to be correctly viewed on any device.

In 2018, Google specialists officially announced that sites without a mobile (adaptive) version will not receive an advantage in the ranking.

The redesign of the resource necessarily implies the implementation of an adaptive layout.

## Think about user, think like user

What problems does your website solve for the user?

Based on a brainstorming session, engaging colleagues and acquaintances, independent individuals, business owners can formulate a whole series of their own wishes and elements that should be included in the updated design of the project.

This approach can really be called: "Think about the user, think like a user". Just put yourself in the place of a person, try to go all the way (to purchase or order services).

## Key website design requirements

The completion or redesign of the site must include the mandatory requirements:

* high download speed;
* optimal amount and combination of colors;
* full disclosure of information on landing pages;
* lack of complex and intuitive incomprehensible navigation;

Simple rules help to achieve high results when redesigning the site!

## The site is out of date: how to understand it and what to do

Have you started to notice a decrease in conversion, the total number of users, a deterioration in behavioral factors and a subsequent decrease in positions in search engines?

It is time to reanimate the site and the only redesign will help in this. We have come across dozens of sites in the stagnation phase. After introducing a new design, functional elements and other solutions that add value to the page, be sure that growth will not take long.
